# Heart_Disease_Prediction
The analysis involves loading heart disease data, preprocessing, training a Logistic Regression model, evaluating its performance, saving the model, and using it to make predictions on new data. The precision score is used to select the best regularization parameter C, and the model's predictions are visualized using a confusion matrix. The final model is saved and loaded for predictions on new data points. This analysis showcases the steps involved in developing a predictive model for heart diseaseÂ classification.
